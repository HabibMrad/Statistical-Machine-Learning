# Statistical Machine Learning

This is the Github repo for the course Statistical Machine Learning offered at Columbia University. I set this up for future students and hope this site can be helpful. Please feel free to email me if you have questions. 

# Advice:

I do not believe there is one book or one problem set to do so that one can magically become an expert in machine learning. That being said, there are a few directions to go so that perhaps you can be on the right track. On top of that, your dilligence is a great contributing factor to determine how far you can push yourself in this field. 

(1) Read as many books as you can and try to replicate the machine learning techniques. This is early stage of getting yourself familiar with machine learning tools and you should feel comfortable of getting your hands dirty. 

Some great books are:
- An Introduction to Statistical Learning [Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani] \href{df}{df}
- An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods [Cristianini]
- Elements of Statistical Learning [Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman]
- Machine Learning [Kevin Murphy]

Programming Languages:
- You should be fluent in both Python and R. 
- You should attempt to replicate same results in C++. 

(2) For intermediate level students, you should be fluent in Step (1). To move beyond here, you need to go to Github or Kaggle and search for new data sets (the ones you have never touched before) and try to replicate Step (1) using new data sets. 

Review this Wiki Site and Search for New Data Set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_research
Once you find something interesting you can go to Github or Kaggle.

A new data set is like a new person you may want to be friends with. You treat it well and learn from it. You will gain experience. The data set does not limit to any form. It can be (1) big of small, (2) supervised or unsupervised, (3) time-series, (4) images, and so on. you need to be able to tell a great story with results from multiple different machine learning techniques given any data sets. 

(3) At an advanced or research level, you are fluent in Step (1) and (2). In fact, you might be too fluent to find them interesting. Moreover, you have looked so many data sets that there isn't a single data form you have not seen before. You start to think how you can contribute to the society and what can be improved. You start asking questions such as "why apples fall?" If you are here, you are an advanced machine learning practitioner. You can override any authors or textbooks. You can design and even invent profitable machine learning products so that perhaps you can go out there to look for investors to finance you idea and start your own company.
